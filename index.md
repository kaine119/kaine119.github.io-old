# Narration

- First-person narration
	- Full perspective of protagonist’s thoughts
	- Allows reader to understand the protagonist’s character and feelings, even when they aren’t obvious in action
- Gives insight into protagonists’ attitude towards the happenings
- Shows protagonist’s motives
- Occasionally directly addresses the readers/listeners 
- Emulates the fact that he’s telling a campfire story to others
- Unreliable narrator
- He is biased towards Lina and against other people, so his description of their characters may not be accurate.	

# Literary Devices
- Comparison (Simile)
	- The narrator constantly uses analogies to describe his experiences, which gives the readers a glimpse into his perception of others and how they affect him.
	- [pg. 211] “I felt myself like a lettuce being unwrapped leaf by leaf until my heart lay cupped in her palm.”
	- He likens his conversation with Lina to her physically exposing his deepest vulnerabilities, which reveals how he views Lina as overwhelming. It also reveals how the narrator is insecure in the presence of Lina. 

# Diction and Syntax
- “...the feeling, of existing in an inviolable cocoon with your lover…” [pg. 211]
- He uses the metaphor of being in a cocoon, which shows how he feels a sense of security from his relationship. However, the usage of the word “inviolable” implies that he is also shutting himself off from the world, escaping from his problems.
