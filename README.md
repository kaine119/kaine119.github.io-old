# Old stuff

This repo contains a lot of random stuff, back when I used `kaine119.github.io` as a convenient static host for 
random stuff.

If you'd like to see what used to be here, clone it and just look around in a web browser; there shouldn't be any
weird dependencies.

## Stuff that used to be here
* `amp`: an AMP test.
* `git`, `git2`: two sets of slides (generated with [slides.com](slides.com)) that I used for CCA sessions about
  git, and how to collaborate with it
* notes: markdown notes from Secondary School (DHS Y3-4)
	* evidence: statistics and stuff for DHS Language Arts essay writing
	* lit: English Literature (Julius Caesar, Unseen)
	* comprehension: list of types of questions that show up for LA comprehension
	* education: notes for a socratic seminar done in class
* `pwapp`: a Google Code Lab on Progressive Web Apps (not sure why this is up here)
* `voluntunity-web`: a web interface to add entries to [Voluntunity](https://github.com/kaine119/voluntunity)
* `webdev-prep`: notes for a web development session
* `wednesday`: a canvas that appends the day of the week to the Wednesday frog
